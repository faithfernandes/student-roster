C867 Scripting and Programming Performance Assessment - Western Governors University

This is a project I had to complete for the C867 Scripting and Programming Performance Assessment through Western Governors University.

The scenario is this:
I am hired to migrate a university's existing student management software to a new platform with C++. The portion I am responsible for is the reading and 
manipulation of the student data. This includes accessing student info such as first name, degree program, and age, as well as manipulating those data points.

This was my first attempt at working with C++, so although it is not a particularly difficult project, I feel like I learned a lot about how C++ works while working 
on this project. I look forward to using this language in the future!
